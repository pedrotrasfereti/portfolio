Throughout the journey of building it, I discovered a genuine passion for the freedom technology provides in solving problems, regardless of their complexity. Since then, I have relentlessly pursued knowledge in programming, with a particular focus on web development. In 2021, I enrolled in the specialized training course at Trybe, where I honed my skills to become a Front-End Developer. During my time there, I completed several projects that enhanced my expertise in creating user-friendly interfaces and optimized web applications. As a developer, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that improved user engagement and streamlined processes. I’m always eager to learn and embrace new challenges, aiming to contribute to projects that make a positive impact."
